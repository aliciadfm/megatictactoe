# Mega Tic Tac Toe
A modified Tic Tac Toe with new mechanics. It consists in 10 Tic tac Toes. Nine of them are small, and the tenth is the big square.

## Instructions
- First player 'X' places its piece wherever he wants, and the second player 'O' has to place his piece in the small TicTacToe which position correspond to the position of the last piece placed. <br />
It is hard to explain, that's why the TicTacToes where you can't place your piece are darker.<br />
- When a player wins a small TicTacToe, the quadrant will be replaced by a single one with the symbol (X, O) which corresponds to the player.<br />
- The winner is the player that wins the big Tic Tac Toe
