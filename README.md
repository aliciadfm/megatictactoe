# Mega Tic Tac Toe
A modified Tic Tac Toe with new mechanics. It consists in 10 Tic tac Toes. Nine of them are small, and the tenth is the big square.

## Instructions
- The first player, represented by 'X', places their piece anywhere on the board.<br />
- The second player, represented by 'O', must place their piece in the small Tic Tac Toe corresponding to the position of the last piece placed by the first player.<br />
	Â· The available Tic Tac Toes where you can place your piece are highlighted, while the others are darker.
- When a player wins a small Tic Tac Toe, the quadrant will be replaced by a single one with the symbol (X or O) corresponding to the winning player.<br />
- The ultimate goal is to win the big Tic Tac Toe.
